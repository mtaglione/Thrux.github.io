Auto-Sizing Settings
====================
THRUX will calculate equipment sizes automatically, but certain parameters can be excluded in the Auto-Sizing settings.  

For example, if the designer would like a conduit size to remain constant or intentionally oversized to account for shaft space, deselect Conduit Size shown below.
