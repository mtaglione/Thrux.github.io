Auto-Sizing Filters
===================

Auto-Sizing Filters present designers with an option to restrict certain materials from being used in their design.

For example, if 400 kCMils are logistically not available from contractors in their region, a designer can omit this by deselecting the cable size.

Furthermore, users can also omit specific conduit sizes or breaker sizes from their design.
