Flag Settings
=============

THRUX provides code validated designs, and presents users with notifications for when their design is violating a code applicable to their project. 

Certain flags can be ignored, or have the visibility setting omitted.  Deselect to omit a flag.

Yellow Flags are warnings which are violations of applicable safety codes.Red Flags are program errors, such as an equipment without a name.

Normal Priority Voltage Drop Threshold
--------------------------------------

A flag is raised when the VD% Net for a piece of distribution equipment exceeds a specified %.  The default value is 2%.  The default threshold for end of line equipment is 5%.

Non-Normal Priorty Voltage Drop Threshold
-----------------------------------------

A flag is raised when the VD Net % for a piece of non-normal distribution equipment, such as a generator or other secondary source of power, exceeds a specified %.  The default value is 2%.  The default threshold for end of line equipment is 5%.

Name
----

A flag is raised when a piece of equipment does not have a name.

Breaker Undersized
------------------

A flag is raised when a breaker's trip setting is smaller than it's frame size.

Frame Undersized
----------------

A flag is raised when an OCPD's Frame Size will not accommodate the associated load.

KAIC Undersized
---------------

A flag is raised when the AIC rating of an equipment will not accommodate the SCC Net value. 

Sets Per
--------

A flag is raised when the current amount of sets of conductors will not accommodate the load.

Phase Undersized
----------------

A flag is raised when the phase size of a conductor will not accommodate the load.

Ground Undersized
-----------------

A flag is raised when a the size of the ground conductor will not accommodate the load. 

Conduit Undersized
------------------

A flag is raised when the maximum fill ratio of the conductor arrangement is exceeded.

Voltage Drop Error
------------------

A flag is raised when the VD% Net is exceeded. 

Neutral Provision
-----------------

A flag is raised when the neutral conductor is undersized.

Equipment Overloaded
--------------------

A flag is raised when a piece of distribution equipment is overloaded.

Equipment Voltage Drop Error
----------------------------

A flag is raised when the VD% Net exceeds the threshold value.
