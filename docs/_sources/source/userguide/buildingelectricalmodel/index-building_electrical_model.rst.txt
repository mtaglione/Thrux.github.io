Building the Electrical Model
=============================

There are 3 main workspaces to build your electrical system: One-Line, Riser, Schedules.  

The goal of these workspaces is to provide the best documentation for construction purposes, and some information is captured on multiple documents.

The locations of equipment are determined by the Architectural Model, or can be determined manually.
